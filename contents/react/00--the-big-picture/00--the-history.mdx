<Intro>

The appearance of React.js dramatically widened the opportunities for front-end developers in creating user-friendly interfaces.

To have a better understanding of React, let’s have a sneak peek at how everything started. I have collected the most significant milestones in the history of React, which you’ll be able to see in this timeline below.

</Intro>

## The need for a better code

Back in 2011, the developers at Facebook started to face some issues with code maintenance. As the Facebook Ads app got an increasing number of features, the team needed more people to keep it running flawlessly. The growing number of team-members and app-features slowed them down as a company. Over time, their app became difficult to handle, as they faced a lot of cascading updates.

After a while, engineers at Facebook couldn’t keep up with these cascading updates. Their code demanded an urgent upgrade to become more efficient.

They had the model right, but they needed to do something about user experience. So, Jordan Walke built a prototype that made the process more efficient, and this marks the birth of React.js.

## Let’s look at the history of React.js on a timeline

_We got a feedback that certain dates were incorrect in our timeline: React was open sourced in May, during the JS ConfUS 2013, and React London 2014 was held on April 7-9. Now, we have updated our timeline. Please, if you find any other inaccuracies, do let us know in the comment section below or on Twitter._

### 2010 – The first signs of React

- Facebook introduced xhp into its php stack and open sourced it.
  Xhp allowed creating composite components. They introduced this syntax later in React.

### 2012 – Something new had started at Facebook

- Facebook Ads became hard to manage, so Facebook needed to come up with a good solution for it. Jordan Walke worked on the prototype and created React.
- April 9: Instagram was acquired by Facebook.
- Instagram wanted to adopt Facebook’s new technology. By this, Facebook had a pressure to decouple React from Facebook and make it open-sourceable. Most of this was done by Pete Hunt.
- Sept 8-12: TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco, Mark Zuckerberg: “Our Biggest Mistake Was Betting Too Much On HTML5”. He promised that Facebook would deliver better mobile experiences very soon.
