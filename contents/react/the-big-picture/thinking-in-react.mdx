<Intro>

React can change how you think about the designs you look at and the apps you build. When you build a user interface with React, you will first break it apart into pieces called _components_. Then, you will describe the different visual states for each of your components. Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll guide you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table with React.

## Start with the mockup {/* start-with-the-mockup */}

Imagine that you already have a JSON API and a mockup from a designer.

The JSON API returns some data that looks like this:

```json
[
  { "category": "Fruits", "price": "$1", "stocked": true, "name": "Apple" },
  {
    "category": "Fruits",
    "price": "$1",
    "stocked": true,
    "name": "Dragonfruit"
  },
  {
    "category": "Fruits",
    "price": "$2",
    "stocked": false,
    "name": "Passionfruit"
  },
  {
    "category": "Vegetables",
    "price": "$2",
    "stocked": true,
    "name": "Spinach"
  },
  {
    "category": "Vegetables",
    "price": "$4",
    "stocked": false,
    "name": "Pumpkin"
  },
  { "category": "Vegetables", "price": "$1", "stocked": true, "name": "Peas" }
]
```

The mockup looks like this:
