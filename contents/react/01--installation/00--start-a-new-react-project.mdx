<Intro>

If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community. Frameworks provide features that most apps and sites eventually need, including routing, data fetching, and generating HTML.

</Intro>

<Note>

**You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for local development.** You can _also_ choose to use Node.js in production, but you don't have to. Many React frameworks support export to a static HTML/CSS/JS folder.

## Production-grade React frameworks

### Next.js

**[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a full-stack React framework.** It's versatile and lets you create React apps of any size--from a mostly static blog to a complex dynamic application. To create a new Next.js project, run in your terminal:

<TerminalBlock>
  npx create-next-app npx create-next-appnpx create-next-appnpx create-next-appnpx create-next-appnpx create-next-appearance
  npx create-next-app
</TerminalBlock>
